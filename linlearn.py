## Read data (20 points)

## Determine value of the 40 linear parameters w0, ..., w39, by discovering the values that minimize the mean squared error between the true values (yi) and the predicted values w0xi0 + ... + w39xi39. You may use analysis or gradient descent (i.e., hill climbing, or descending in this case) (60 points)

## Output answers as params.csv. This should have two rows: one for the labels  w0, ..., w39 and one for the values (20 points)
